## üó£Ô∏è Translation Status

### How you can help
* Work on translations into languages not finished yet by either editing the `po/<language_code>.po` file, making a new one by running `cp po/rhino-setup.pot po/<language_code>.po`, or using weblate (https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rhino-linux/rhino-setup/). Once you have completed or partially completed a po file, make a PR and we will merge it! Our goal is to have as many languages translated as possible due to the amount of people who may not be fluent in English.
